# System_Development_CNN_Master_Thesis

## Description
This is my repository for the final project (or thesis) I did in my Master's degree of Computer Science based on Convolutional Neural Networks (also known as CNNs).
Here I am going to describe the different phases I passed through as well as the different notebooks used in the project. For more detailed information, the memory I wrote down is here https://academica-e.unavarra.es/handle/2454/39829 (only in Spanish right now).
